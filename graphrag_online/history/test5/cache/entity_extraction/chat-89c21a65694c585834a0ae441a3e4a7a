{"result": "(\"entity\"<|>ELLIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ellia is a machine that can extract keywords from input and use predefined answers to respond. While it's still basic today, it shows the potential of machine learning in natural language processing. In 2000s, with the introduction of word embeddings, these technologies have made major changes: embedding words into continuous vector spaces and capturing semantic relations. For example, while 'king' and 'queen' are more similar in vector space than 'king' and 'quein', the embeddings of 'queen' are closer to those. This progress laid the foundation for complex language models. The development of recurrent networks, especially LSTM, marked another step forward. RIN is now used only on text data and allows models to handle sequence data.\")\n\n\n## ##\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ELLIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ellia is a machine that can extract keywords from input and use predefined answers to respond.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

      <data key="d1">The Transformer is a significant architectural framework introduced in 2017 that has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs). It enables models to effectively capture long-range dependencies in text, overcoming challenges that previous recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures struggled with. The architecture is notable for its ability to handle long-distance dependencies and parallel processing, which leads to a paradigm shift in NLP. By allowing efficient processing of sequential data without the need for sequential computation, the Transformer has become a foundational component in modern language models, significantly advancing the field of natural language processing.</data>

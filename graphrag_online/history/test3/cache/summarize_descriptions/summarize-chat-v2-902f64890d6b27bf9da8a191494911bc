{"result": "GPT3 is a large language model developed by an organization, part of the GPT series, released in 2020. It is notable for its significant number of parameters, with one description stating 17501 parameters and another indicating 175 billion parameters. The discrepancy in the parameter count is resolved by recognizing that the first description likely refers to a different model or a misstatement, while the second provides the correct figure.

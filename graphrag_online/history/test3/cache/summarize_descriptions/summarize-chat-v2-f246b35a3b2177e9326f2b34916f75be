{"result": "GPT is a series of large language models developed by OpenAI, known for their significant impact on the普及 of large language models (LLMs). These models are part of a framework or organization created by OpenAI that functions as a pre-trained transformer model designed for natural language processing tasks. GPT was released in 2018 and demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-training large transformer models on massive text corpora, establishing a foundation for subsequent advancements in natural language processing.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

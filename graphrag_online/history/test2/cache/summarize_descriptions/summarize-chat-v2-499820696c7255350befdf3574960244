{"result": "NLP, short for Natural Language Processing, is a field that has undergone significant development over decades. It began with rule-based and statistical methods, followed by advancements in word embeddings and complex language models. In recent years, the field has seen significant advancements due to the development of large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architecture. These developments have collectively transformed NLP into a powerful area of study and application within artificial intelligence.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

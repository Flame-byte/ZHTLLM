{"result": "TEXT SUMMARIZATION is an application area within the realm of large language models (LLMs) where the technology is used to automatically compress lengthy documents into concise summaries. This process saves time and effort for users by distilling the essential information from longer texts. It is also recognized as a natural language processing task that LLMs can be fine-tuned for, highlighting its importance in the field of NLP. The dual nature of TEXT SUMMARIZATION—both as an application and a trainable task—underscores its significance in improving efficiency in information retrieval and processing.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
